### About Me

I am a programmer with a first-degree disability due to cerebral palsy, which causes some challenges with speech and hand movements. However, this doesn’t prevent me from actively programming and continuously improving my skills.

### Hobbies

One of my main hobbies is watching anime 🎥. I’m a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki’s works. I also enjoy movies and series, and I listen to music 🎶 every day.
